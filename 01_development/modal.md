## What is a Modal?

A modal is a dialog that is displayed on top of everything and gives the user actions and information.

## How to create a Modal

You can easily create a modal using the `equora ipc modal instance` command.

instance( **appName**, **title**, **description**, **actionsJsonPath**, **iconPath**, **useIcon** )

Example:

```bash
$ equora ipc modal instance "Name" "Title" "Description" "path/to/your/actions.json" "icon.png" true
```

If you make the iconPath empty, then it will use the default icon. (See image above)

## Actions

You can make actions for your modal inside the `actions.json` file.

It is a list of columns and rows.

to create a column, you can use an array of actions.

```json
[ // column
    [ // row
        { // action
        }
    ]
]
```

Lets take a look at an action:

```json
{
    "type": "button",
    "primary": true,
    "width": 30,
    "iconPath": "/home/enviction/MacTahoe-icon-theme/src/actions/symbolic/object-unlocked-symbolic.svg",
    "label": "",
    "fillWidth": false
}
```

This action is of `type` **button**, and it is the `primary` action, which makes it use the **accent color**. It has a width of 30px, leaving this empty will make it autosize. It has an icon, using iconPath for the path to the icon, and a label of an empty string. It also doesn't fill the width of the row.

Lets look at another one

```json
{
    "type": "button",
    "label": "Deny"
}
```

This is a very simple button, with a label of "Deny". Since this does not set any width or fillWidth, it will fill up the entire row.

Theres of course not only buttons, but also inputs.

```json
{
    "type": "input",
    "variable": "title",
    "inputType": "password",
    "placeholder": "",
    "command": "notify-send '$title' 'Yay'"
}
```

This is an input, with a variable of "title", an inputType of "password", a placeholder of an empty string, and a command of "notify-send '$title' 'Yay'".

The command is executed when the user presses enter.

But what if you wanted to make the button also run the command?

To do that give the input an `id`, lets say `inputAction`  
Then give the button an `callbackRedirect` with the `inputAction` id.

```json
{
    "type": "input",
    "variable": "title",
    "inputType": "password",
    "placeholder": "",
    "command": "notify-send '$title' 'Yay'",
    "id": "inputAction"
},
{
    "type": "button",
    "primary": true,
    "label": "Submit",
    "callbackRedirect": "inputAction" 
}
```

Now when pressing the button, the command of the input will be executed.

## Example file

/// details | actions.json
```json
[
	[
		{
			"id": "input",
			"type": "input",
			"variable": "title",
			"inputType": "password",
			"placeholder": "",
			"command": "equora ipc popup openPopup '' 'MyModal' 'This is a Title' '$title' 200 'banner'"
		},
		{
			"type": "button",
			"primary": true,
			"width": 50,
			"iconPath": "",
			"label": "Send",
			"callbackRedirect": "input",
			"fillWidth": false
		}
	],
	[
		{
			"type": "button",
			"label": "Deny"
		}
	]
]
```
